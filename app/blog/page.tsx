        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          I got my start coding in middle school where I faintly remember
          scratch projects with my friend from boyscouts. I always wanted to get
          good at coding because I always wanted to make my own games. I made..
          alot of progress since then and im really proud of alot of the work I
          have done so far. I spend most of my time either gaming or programming
          but I also really love D&D and gardening whenever I can.

        <h3>Coding</h3>
        <p>
          I do cool stuff for shiptest which I think is my favorite code to
          write since I really like the feedback loop of coding games
        </p>
        <p>
          I only recently started learning web development, but I already have
          been drinking the full stack soup. I have extreamly mixed feelings
          about tailwind css but have been finding next.js and by proxy react to
          be a lovely tool to work with
